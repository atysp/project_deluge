## Synopsis:

Given the global and UK distribution of human habitation, flooding is one of the most common and impactful natural distasters which can occur. [Analysis of satellite data](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03695-w) coupled with [predictions on future changes](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/) to the climate suggest this is an issue which will only get more frequent and severe.

Flooding can occur from a number of sources:

- Surface water (from rainfall run-off, or from the fresh or dirty water systems)
- Rivers, due to blockage or excess rainfall
- Seas, due to sea level rise or storm surge.

The purpose of this exercise is to develop prediction/classification routines for flood probability and impact for the UK
